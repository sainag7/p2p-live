Implement the following UI layout + alignment fixes across Plan Trip + List/Buses page + bottom nav.

1) PLAN TRIP – ADD SPACE BETWEEN SEARCH BAR AND TOP DESTINATIONS
- On the Plan Trip page, add vertical spacing between:
  - The search input container
  - The “Top Destinations” section header/list
- Use consistent spacing from design system (e.g., 12px–20px margin-top).
- Do NOT add padding inside the search input itself — spacing should be external.
- Ensure spacing behaves correctly:
  - When dropdown is open
  - When dropdown is closed
  - On mobile and desktop

2) LIST PAGE – FIX PADDING FOR “CLOSEST STOP TO YOU”
- Adjust padding so the “Closest Stop to You” header:
  - Aligns horizontally with other section headers
  - Has consistent left/right padding with cards and content below
- Ensure:
  - No extra left indent compared to Active Buses
  - Vertical spacing above and below matches other sections
- Remove any accidental double padding (e.g., nested containers adding padding twice).

3) BOTTOM NAV – CHANGE “List” TO “Buses”
- Replace bottom nav label:
  - “List” → “Buses”
- Update any routing references if needed (route name can remain /list internally if desired).

4) BOTTOM NAV TEXT ALIGNMENT FIX (IMPORTANT)
Currently “Plan Trip” appears slightly lower than others (likely due to:
- Larger icon when active
- Icon scaling on highlight
- Different line-height)

Fix requirements:
- All bottom nav items must:
  - Have equal height containers
  - Use flex column layout: icon on top, label below
  - Vertically center contents
- Active state must NOT increase icon size in a way that shifts layout.
  - If scaling icon on active, use transform: scale() without affecting layout (no margin/padding shift).
  - Ensure consistent icon box height across states.
- Text labels (“Map”, “Buses”, “Plan Trip”) must:
  - Have same font-size
  - Same line-height
  - Same baseline alignment
- Verify:
  - All three labels are perfectly aligned horizontally.
  - Highlighted state does not change vertical position.

5) FINAL CHECKS
- Bottom nav should feel clean and modern.
- No jitter when switching tabs.
- Plan Trip no longer sits lower than the other two.
- Spacing between search bar and Top Destinations looks intentional and balanced.
